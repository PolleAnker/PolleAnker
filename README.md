- 👋 Hi, I’m @PolleAnker
- 👀 I’m interested in designing and developing applications that relates to Virtual Reality, entertainment or artificial intelligence in one way or another.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to present programming concepts and terms to people with little to no experience with it, 
      and I always try to learn more about developing applications, as I think it is important to keep an open mind and treat life as a learning experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Virtual Reality for entertainment.
- 📫 How to reach me: poulankerjensen@yahoo.dk.
